#### Repository **:** [https://github.com/parabola-x2/Quadrocopter\_VirtualReality](https://github.com/parabola-x2/Quadrocopter_VirtualReality)

**Team Android Application and Virtual Reality**

Visualize the quadcopter in **Google Cardboard VR** and enable flight control through head movements.

* **Head movement signals** are transmitted via **UDP** to the quadcopter.
* The virtual reality device used is an **Android smartphone** equipped with **Google Cardboard**.
* A dedicated Google Cardboard application will be developed using **Unreal Engine 4** and the **Google VR Plugin**.
* The system can later be adapted for other VR platforms such as **Oculus Rift** or **HTC Vive**.
* Communication between the smartphone, the **Simulink simulation**, and eventually the real quadcopter is established through **UDP protocols**.



#### Description:

Task is to bring a Simulink-based quadrocopter model to Google Cardboard VR

A quadrocopter-model based on MATLAB/Simulink will be used to show the behaviour of a quadrocopter in a virtual reality environment. The control of the object will be the movement of the head.<br>

The virtual reality device is a android smartphone with google cardboard. A google cardboard app will be developed with Unreal Engine 4 and the Google VR Plugin. This can be adapted to an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive device later.

The communication between the smartphone and the Simulink simulation goes via UDP communication.

### Unreal Model:

#### -Block Diagram-

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Unreal_BlockDiagram.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The block diagram describes the architecture of the visual simulation of Unreal Engine 4. The environment(or level in Unreal Engine) contains a representation of the user, which will provide basic movements such as go forward, turn left, turn right... Beside that, the level also contains Actors, which is interactable objects. The interacting function such as collitions or control or user's actions will create an event that triggers the movement of the object according to physical principles.\
Moreover, Unreal can also send/receive UDP/TCP data packages from outside with the help of local C++ functions.
